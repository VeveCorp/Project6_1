# Project6_1
# 1. I am giving you the files InfixTreeBuilder.h and .cpp and a main so you can run it.  You can enter an expression 3 * 4 and it will return 12
Your job is to take this code and modify it to take post fix expressions  e.g. 3 4 *  and return the same answer.
You should assume the same base grammar, at the same time recognizing that postfix requires no parentheses to work properly.
Your new files will be PostfixTreeBuilder.h and .cpp and a main.  You should test with complex enough expressions to be sure it works!!!!!!
